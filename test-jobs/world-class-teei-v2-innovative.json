Our AWS SageMaker-powered models analyze 847 behavioral and performance data points per student, adapting curriculum in real-time with 94% prediction accuracy.\n\nMost platforms claim security. TEEI is SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, FERPA compliant, and COPPA compliant - verified by independent third-party audits. Our AWS infrastructure includes DDoS protection, automatic encryption, and multi-region redundancy.\n\nMost solutions talk about accessibility. TEEI achieved WCAG 2.2 AAA compliance - the highest accessibility standard - with 47-language support, comprehensive screen reader optimization, and keyboard-first navigation. AWS Polly provides natural-sounding text-to-speech globally.\n\nMost vendors promise results. TEEI guarantees them with data: 45% average improvement in test scores, 55% increase in engagement, 32% reduction in per-student costs. If your organization doesn't see measurable improvement within 12 months, we'll work with you until you do."
