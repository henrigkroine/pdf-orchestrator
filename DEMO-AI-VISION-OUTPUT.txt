⚠️  Critical Violations: 2
   ❌ Page 1: Logo clearspace violation - "Together for Ukraine" logo has insufficient padding (needs 20pt minimum)
   ❌ Page 1: Minor color inconsistency - Some accent elements use #66B3CC instead of official Sky #C9E4EC

💡 Recommendations:
   ✅ Increase logo clearspace to 20pt on all sides
   ✅ Update accent colors from #66B3CC to official Sky (#C9E4EC)
   ✅ Consider adding more whitespace between sections for better breathing room
   ✅ Text hierarchy is good but could be enhanced with slightly larger subheadings

✨ Strengths:
   ✅ Excellent use of TEEI Nordshore (#00393F) as primary color
   ✅ Strong visual hierarchy with clear headline prominence
   ✅ Good balance of text and whitespace
   ✅ Professional, clean layout with proper grid alignment
   ✅ Typography correctly uses Lora for headlines and Roboto for body
   ✅ Authentic, warm photography that aligns with brand guidelines

📝 Summary:
This document demonstrates strong design fundamentals and good brand alignment.
The visual hierarchy is clear, with prominent headlines and well-structured content.
Color usage is mostly correct with effective use of Nordshore and Sand palette.
Minor issues with logo clearspace and one accent color variation prevent an A grade.
With the recommended adjustments, this would easily achieve A/A+ quality.

✅ VALIDATION PASSED (B+ grade meets production threshold)
