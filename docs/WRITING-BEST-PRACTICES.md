## Grammar and Style Rules

### Sentence Structure

**Ideal Length:** 15-20 words average
- Short sentences (8-12 words): Emphasis and clarity
- Medium sentences (15-20 words): Main content
- Long sentences (20-25 words): Complex ideas (sparingly)

**Variety:** Mix short, medium, and long sentences

```markdown
❌ Too monotonous:
TEEI provides education. We serve students. We work with partners. We create impact.

✅ Better variety:
TEEI transforms education for displaced students. Through strategic partnerships, we deliver
world-class curricula that create lasting impact. Join us.
```

### Active Voice

**Target:** 70%+ active voice

```markdown
❌ Passive: "Education is being transformed by TEEI"
✅ Active: "TEEI transforms education"

❌ Passive: "Students are empowered by our programs"
✅ Active: "Our programs empower students"
```

### Clear, Concise Writing

**Remove weak words:**
- very, really, quite, rather, somewhat
- actually, basically, literally, just
- sort of, kind of, a bit

**Replace with stronger alternatives:**
```markdown
❌ "very important" → ✅ "critical" or "essential"
❌ "really good results" → ✅ "exceptional outcomes"
❌ "quite effective" → ✅ "proven" or "successful"
```

---

## Messaging Effectiveness

### Value Proposition

**Formula:** [Action] + [Benefit] + [Differentiation]

```markdown
✅ "TEEI delivers university-quality education to displaced students through innovative
partnerships that create pathways to economic mobility."

Components:
- Action: "delivers"
- Benefit: "university-quality education to displaced students"
- Differentiation: "innovative partnerships" + "pathways to economic mobility"
```

**Placement:** First paragraph, ideally first sentence

### Call-to-Action (CTA)

**Strong CTA elements:**
1. Action verb
2. Specific next step
3. Value reminder
4. Urgency (appropriate)

```markdown
❌ Weak: "Contact us to learn more"
✅ Strong: "Partner with us today to transform education for 10,000+ displaced students.
          Email partnerships@teei.org to schedule your consultation."
```

### Persuasion Techniques

**Balance all three:**

**Ethos (credibility):**
- Track record, partnerships, certifications
- "Trusted by Google, AWS, and Cornell University"

**Pathos (emotion):**
- Stories, human impact, hope
- "Imagine a refugee student becoming a software engineer"

**Logos (logic):**
- Data, research, evidence
- "85% of graduates secure employment within 6 months"

## Storytelling Techniques

### Narrative Arc

**Structure:** Exposition → Rising Action → Climax → Falling Action → Resolution

```markdown
Example:

Exposition: "Meet Sofia, a 19-year-old Ukrainian refugee who fled Kyiv in 2022."

Rising Action: "Despite her dream of becoming a teacher, she had no access to higher
education in her host country."

Climax: "Then Sofia discovered TEEI's partnership with Cornell University."

Falling Action: "Through our program, Sofia completed her teaching certification while
mentoring younger students."

Resolution: "Today, Sofia teaches at a refugee education center, empowering 50 students
with the same hope she found."
```

### Before/After Transformation

**Show the journey:**

```markdown
Before: [Current state/problem]
Journey: [Actions taken/solution implemented]
After: [New state/impact achieved]

Example:
Before: "75% of displaced students lack access to university education"
Journey: "TEEI partnered with AWS to create cloud-based learning platform"
After: "Now 2,500 students in 12 countries earn accredited degrees"
```

## Inclusive Language Guide

### Gender-Neutral Language

```markdown
❌ "he/his/him" (exclusive) → ✅ "they/their" or "he or she"
❌ "mankind" → ✅ "humanity" or "people"
❌ "chairman" → ✅ "chair" or "chairperson"
❌ "salesmanship" → ✅ "sales skills"
```

### Person-First Language

```markdown
❌ "disabled students" → ✅ "students with disabilities"
❌ "the poor" → ✅ "people experiencing poverty"
❌ "victims" → ✅ "survivors" or specific term (refugees, displaced persons)
```

### Empowering Language

```markdown
❌ Condescending:
"We help disadvantaged students who need our assistance."

✅ Empowering:
"We partner with talented students to unlock their potential through education."
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Placeholder Text

**Always replace:**
- XX students, TBD date, [INSERT NAME]
- Lorem ipsum, coming soon, update this

### 2. Jargon Overload

**Before/After:**
```markdown
❌ "Our methodology leverages synergistic partnerships to optimize educational outcomes
through a scalable paradigm."

✅ "We partner with universities to deliver quality education that creates real opportunity."
```

### 3. Vague Claims

**Be specific:**
```markdown
❌ "We've helped many students achieve great success."
✅ "We've enabled 2,500 students to earn degrees, with 85% employed within 6 months."
```

### 4. Feature Dumping

**Focus on benefits:**
```markdown
❌ Features: "Our platform has 50 courses, 20 instructors, and cloud-based delivery."
✅ Benefits: "Access world-class education anytime, anywhere, with expert instructors."
```
