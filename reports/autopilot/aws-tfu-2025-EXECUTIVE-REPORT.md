# Executive Summary: Building Europe's Cloud-Native Workforce

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic multi-year partnership between TEEI and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale cloud skills training for displaced Ukrainian learners across Europe. The objectives are to increase AWS certification completion rates, improve employment outcomes, and establish a framework for measurable impact.

The target audience includes AWS EMEA public sector leadership, TEEI board of directors, and program managers. However, the document is missing key quality assessments across TFU compliance, AI design validation, visual quality, and overall world-class standards. Addressing these gaps will be critical to ensure the program delivers on its ambitious goals.

## 2. Strengths

- Clear objectives focused on scaling impact for an important target population
- Multi-year partnership approach enables sustained investment and iteration  
- Emphasis on measurable outcomes like certifications and job placements
- Engagement of key stakeholders across AWS and TEEI to drive execution

## 3. Quality Assessment

- TFU Compliance (Layer 1): No score provided. A thorough TFU review is needed to identify any potential legal, ethical or reputational risks.
- AI Design Validation: No assessment done. Engaging AI experts to stress test the program design and underlying assumptions is recommended.
- Visual Quality (Gemini): No Gemini score available. Professional visual design of participant-facing materials will be important for engagement and credibility.
- Overall World-Class: Unable to assess overall quality without the above layers completed.

## 4. Recommendations 

To improve the quality and impact potential of this document, I recommend:

1. Conduct a full TFU compliance review, with particular attention to data privacy, intellectual property, and AWS platform terms of service as they relate to the proposed use cases.

2. Engage an independent AI expert or advisory firm to validate the program design, target outcomes, and underlying assumptions about the link between cloud skilling and employment for the target population. 

3. Develop participant-facing materials (e.g. a program website, onboarding guides, progress dashboards) with a professional visual designer, and assess against Gemini standards.

4. With the above layers completed, assess the program against TEEI's overall world-class partnership criteria and address any remaining gaps prior to launch.

## 5. Next Steps

1. Share this executive summary with key stakeholders at AWS and TEEI for input and alignment.

2. Assign owners and due dates for each of the quality assessment layers and recommendations. 

3. Reconvene in 2 weeks to review progress and outline next steps to finalize the partnership agreement and implementation plan.

4. Set quarterly business reviews with joint AWS-TEEI program leadership to track progress against target outcomes and continuously elevate quality across all layers.
